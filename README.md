# vCard File Splitter

Split or merge vcf and vCard files without applying any further processing to original file lines.  
  
This application requires the [.NET 7.0 Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/7.0); it can be automatically downloaded and installed on the application's first run.  
  
This source code implementation is not intended to fulfill [RFC 6350: vCard Format Specification](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc6350); it just shows a vCard preview, with few properties, since its solely scope is to split a single 'multiple vCards' file into separated files or to merge them into a single file.  
  
I wrote this application to split my phone `AddressBook.vcf` into separated contacts' files, to share them with other applications.
